qHooK
======
qHooK is very simple and straight forward python script (dependent on pydbg) which hooks user defined Win32 APIs in any process and monitor then while process is running and at last prepare a CSV report with various interesting information which can  help reverse engineer to track down / analyse unknown exploit samples / shellcode.

This is how the final CSV looks(Obviously after little bit excel formatting).
